### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Sourabh Sah
I am a Masterâ€™s student at IIIT Ranchi, specializing in Computer Science and Engineering with a focus on Data Science and AI. With 2 years of experience as a Software Engineer at Tech Mahindra, I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems and drive innovation.

During my tenure at Tech Mahindra, I collaborated with cross-functional teams and worked on impactful projects. My background in Electronics and Communication, coupled with a minor in Computer Science, has given me a strong foundation in both hardware and software domains.

I am skilled in Python, Django, TensorFlow, Pandas, SQL, and cloud platforms like AWS. My technical toolkit also includes version control with Git, Linux, and PL/SQL. Certified in Machine Learning with Python, I constantly seek to enhance my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in AI and data science.

I believe in giving back to the tech community by participating in knowledge-sharing events, workshops, and seminars. Open to opportunities that allow me to apply my data science expertise and collaborate with like-minded professionals worldwide.
